Lying in my bed,
I hear the clock tick and think of you.
Caught up in circles,
confusion is nothing new.
Flashback: warm nights,
almost left behind.
Suitcase of memories,
time after--

Sometimes you picture me,
I'm walking too far ahead.
You're calling to me;
I can't hear what you've said.
Then you say, "Go slow";
I fall behind.
The second hand unwinds.

After my picture fades
and darkness has turned to gray,
watching through windows,
you're wondering if I'm okay.
Secrets stolen
from deep inside.
The drum beats out of time.

If you're lost,
you can look
and you will find me,
time after time.
If you fall,
I will catch you,
I'll be waiting,
time after time.
